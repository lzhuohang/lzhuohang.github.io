I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes **Large Language Models**, **World Models**, **Agents**.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Yong Li](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/liyong/zh_CN/index.htm) and be a member of [FIB LAB](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I will be a **PhD** student specializing in Electronic Information in **2026 Fall**.
